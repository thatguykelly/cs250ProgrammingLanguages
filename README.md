We needed to create software to interact with the zoo's RFID chips on the animals. It needed to update information on the animal for maintenence. With it we can remotely access and edit the data. First and foremost I love the switch function. I believe I understand that function well. Im able to create options and depending on selection it will just run the function called. Not sure about enhance, more understand is with the Java File Writer code and functions. I'm interested in learning more about that. I would like to add some layer of security into the program. I think it would help if there was a log on for each RFID chip. The vectors and arrays were challenging for me. I've become a bit avid to cplusplus.com. It had been great beneficial. I believe the spacing of the grid layout will come in handy in the future. It's all about data and how we view the data. It's nice to have the knowledge on how to code for the viewer. I kept the main function small and there is room to add animals in the future, depending on RFID's hardware restrictions. I tried to make sure the functions and variable were concise, so if another developer sees it they know what I meant. I also always comment pretty thoroughly, hoping not to overexplain.
